I am Gabriele, a PhD student in Economics at  *[GREDEG, CNRS - Université Côte d'Azur](https://gredeg.univ-cotedazur.fr/)* (Nice), in a joint program with *[Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna](https://www.santannapisa.it/it/formazione/international-doctoral-programme-economics)* (Pisa).

My research interests lie in **political economy** and **inequality**. My methodological approach spans from **network science** and **computer simulations** to standard econometric analysis.

Before my PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), where I also obtained my M.Sc in Economics, graduating *summa cum laude*.
