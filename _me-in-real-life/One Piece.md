**I am a One Piece weekly reader.**

If you read the section above, you know about my first curse (Inter). Well, waiting for the weekly chapter of **One Piece** is the second great curse of my existence.

My academic career is currently defined by a high-stakes race against **Eiichiro Oda**. The goal is simple: **I must finish my PhD before Luffy finds the One Piece.**

The challenge is officially on. We are currently observing who has the slower pacing: my dissertation writing or Oda's story progression. It’s going to be a close call.

> **Open Call for Theories:**

> If you have a solid theory about the *Void Century* or the *Will of D.*, please send me an email. I am more than happy to discuss them.
