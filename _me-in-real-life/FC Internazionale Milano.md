**I am an Inter fan.**

Yes, this is one of the two great curses of my life. (To discover the second one, you will have to keep discovering Me in Real Life).

I am writing this on *February 25th, 2026*, with the hope of winning the Scudetto. If you are reading this in the future and I haven't updated this section, it means one of two things: either we are still celebrating, or I am too heartbroken to talk about Inter.

Regardless of the outcome: *Amala, sempre.*
