Being a scuba diver has been my dream since childhood. I finally fulfilled this ambition in 2024, obtaining my **PADI Open Water** certification in the stunning waters of **Villasimius, Sardinia**.

I enjoyed the deep so much that I earned my **Advanced Open Water** license the following year.

Below are some photos of my underwater adventures.
